title: Efficient algorithms for infinite features in big data
---


For the first project of the [big data analytics programming course](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H00Y4AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp2617152), we implemented several algorithms for efficiently dealing with big data in c++. 
We implemented a perceptron model (the building block of the neural network) and naive bayes with two variants to deal with infinite features (min-count and feature hashing). Efficiency was a major requirement (as well as model correctness), and the c++ code was written to optimize memory usage and runtime through efficient use of pointers and references.

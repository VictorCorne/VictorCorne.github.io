Bachelor's thesis: Evaluating Multi-Agent control mechanisms in the Packetworld
---

In this bachelor's thesis (submitted for the bachelor of informatics), I researched how different control mechanisms compare for coordinating multi-agent systems. For this, I used the [packetworld simulator](https://github.com/PacketWorld/PacketWorld) and I researched fully centralized, semi-centralized and fully decentralized architectures.

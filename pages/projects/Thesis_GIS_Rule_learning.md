Title: "Thesis: Relational Constraint Learning of Low-Voltage Electrical Networks"
---


In this thesis (submitted for the master of computer science (option AI)), I researched the underlying knowledge (constraints, patterns and rules) behind low voltage networks, with the aim of detecting and correcting errors that could come up in the models (digital twin). This thesis was in collaboration with [Energyville](https://www.energyville.be/en) in [another project](https://ai.kuleuven.be/stories/post/2021-11-03-energy-forecasting/).

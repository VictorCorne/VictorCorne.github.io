## Internship: NDA-sensitive project

In the summer of 2023 I performed an internship at [GIM-Smart Geo Insights](https://www.gim.be/en). The internship in itself was very pleasant, and even though the project I worked on was very interesting, I signed an NDA agreement, so details cannot be shared. What I can share however is that I worked with satelite imagery and computer vision to research alternatives in the context of an ongoing project.
- skills: Computer Vision, Research, geo-data
- status: Completed (Summer 2023)

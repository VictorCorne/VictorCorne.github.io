Hey, welcome!

This is my personal webpage where I keep track of my portfolio and all my projects (past, ongoing, future). While this site is a bit of a Work in progress at the moment, feel free to look around!

[The Projects page](all_projects) is currently the most interesting one on this portfolio. It contains my most interesting projects relating to computer science that I have done.

On this page, some projects that I completed, sorted on size.

Most of those projects come from the courses I took on, which is logical since they fit really closely to my interests

# Large Projects
The following are all projects with a greater scope where I learnt a lot from them. Most of them took multiple months to complete
- [RAG Pipeline with sentence embeddings](projects/RAG_IRSE)
- [Thesis: Relational Constraint Learning of Low-Voltage Electrical Networks](projects/Thesis_GIS_Rule_learning)
- [Natural Language Model to mimic chats messages from friends](projects/ChatCloner)
- [Internship: NDA-sensitive project](projects/InternshipGIM)
- [Bachelor's thesis: Evaluating Multi-Agent control mechanisms in the Packetworld](projects/BachelorPacketWorld)
- [OCaml Interpreter for a time-reversible programming language](projects/OCamlInterpreter)
- [Large scale software development in fictitious setting](projects/AssemAssist)
- [Website for fictitious football fan club](projects/football_website)

# Medium Projects
All those projects had a somewhat more limited scope, but were all still very enjoyable and had a very rich learning experience.
- [Efficient algorithms for infinite features in big data](projects/big_data_infinite_features)
- [Hardware acceleration using CPU Intrinsics (C++)](projects/big_data_hardware_intrinsics)
- [Gigabytes data-analysis of NBA statistics using hadoop](projects/big_data_hadoop)
- Game jams with Godot Engine (international team)
- Transformer Language Model for short stories
- Parallel implementation of the game of life using MPI (December 2023)
- Parallel implementation of matrix products using OpenMP (December 2023)
- Community Detection using a Genetic Algorithm with a focus on efficient datastructures and algorithms (December 2020)

# Various Projects
- Hardware Modelling for traffic Lights in Verilog (May 2022)
- Monte-carlo simulation of plasma particles in a Tokamak-reactor in matlab (December 2022)
- First Order Logic modelling of Laser Systems (March 2023)


# Small Projects
These are all small projects who are relatively limited in scope and do not deserve their own entry as a "big project". However, all were very enjoyable and valuable as I learnt some interesting things in all of them.

- Automatic Plotting of Study Progress
- Generating LaTeX presentations from custom md notes
- Making a personal website

## Retrieval Augmented Generation pipeline for scientific papers using sentence embeddings
In this project for the information retrieval and search engines course at KULeuven, we developped a RAG ([retrieval augmented generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation)) pipeline to answer questions (in natural language) relating to scientific papers. The assignment gave a lot of freedom in our implementation, and we used sentence transformers to embed papers and queries. We also implemented search acceleration and compression of the dataset.

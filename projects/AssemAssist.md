## Large scale software development for fictitious automotive factory
For the [software design course](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/2019/syllabi/n/X0D45AN.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp1651664) 
we were tasked to develop a large scale software system with the whole class (four people). While this was a project took place in the context of a ficticious factory, the setting was not the focus of the course, as we studied elegant software design and implemented it ourselves. We worked in agile sprints and used git. We were judged on the quality of the software (test coverage, code quality, software design, ...).

- skills: git, agile, software development
- status: Completed (May 2022)

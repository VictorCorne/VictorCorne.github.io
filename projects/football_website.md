## Website for fictitious football club
In our first year of university, we designed a website for a fictitious football club (for the [software tools course](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/2019/syllabi/v/e/X0A22CE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp706384)). We worked with MySQL and the ASP DotNET framework and used the Model View Controller paradigm to build our very first "large" project at university in a team of three.
- skills: DotNET, MySQL, MVC
- status: Completed (May 2020)

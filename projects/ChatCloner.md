## Natural Language Model to mimic chats messages from friends

In this (very casual) project with some friends, we try to make a natural language model to mimic the group chat between us and the friends in the project. 

This project is still ongoing, and my role in it is the whole ML framework. We start off with a simple Bag of Words model as a baseline and will use several other models in the future (RNN, LSTM, Transformers, Fine-tuning of other models). This is a (very fun!) exercise in teamwork, task delegation, NLP and deep learning in python.

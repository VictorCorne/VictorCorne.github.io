Hi, welcome!

This is my personal webpage where I keep track of my portfolio, all my projects (past, ongoing, future) and followed courses. 

<!-- This site is in beta, 
 While this site is not fully completed yet (there can always be more), you can still feel free to have look around. -->

[The Projects Page](all_projects) contains the most interesting projects (relating to computer science) that I have performed in the last five years, and the [Education Page](education) contains an overview of all courses I have taken during my studies. You can also contact me at the [Contacts Page](contact).

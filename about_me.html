<h1>About me</h1>
On this page on the corner of my portfolio, I present to you a high-level overview of who I am beyond the just pure technical side of me.

While I do not expose too many details (I like to keep some things private), I hope this offers you a glimpse of who I am beyond just the pure technical portfolio.

    <summary>Student Life</summary>
    <p>During my masters degree in Leuven, I was a very active student.</p>
    
    <p>In between my studies, I balanced my workload to continuously meet new people, practice new sports, organize events, join all sorts of events, enjoy nature, and much more.</p>
    
    <p>
        During the studies I was the "peter" (godfather) of twenty students, and in my "kot" (student residence), I was the "gangverantwoordelijke" (hallway manager, though this is too much of a loaded term in my opinion). 
    </p>
    <p>
        I <b>really</b> loved being gangverantwoordelijke and peter of so many students. Helping them in everything, big or small, during those years really made me happy. At our kot I did my best to make them feel at home, with my petekinderen I helped them through their studies, and with my friends I organized activities so we could all see each other regularly.

    <summary>Nature and Biking</summary>
    <p>
        I am a big enjoyer of nature and biking, and I had the chance of combining both in Leuven (at the Heverleebos). Multiple times every month I aranged my workload so I could spend some afternoons or evenings riding my bike in the forest and lose myself in the various paths, enjoying the scenery. 
        I also kept a <a href="pages/pictures/nature">photo album of some beautiful places</a>.

    <summary>Martial Arts</summary>
    <p>
        In my youth, I did five years of Aikido, and during my studies I also practiced several martial arts. I practiced self-defence, taekwondo, and recently I have also started jiu-jitsu close to my home town.

    <summary>Computer Science</summary>
    <p>
        Computer science is a big passion of mine, and deserves its own pages (<a href="all_projects">Projects</a> and <a href="education">Education</a>)
